# *TFG_AD_risk_factors*: Uncovering Environmental Risk Factors through GWAS


This project aims to identify environmental risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data. By merging and filtering GWAS summary statistics from multiple traits, we investigate genetic overlaps between AD and environmental risk factors. The analysis is performed using R and Python, and various statistical tests (e.g., Hypergeometric, Fisher's Exact, Monte Carlo simulations) to validate the results.

## Overview
### 1. Data Processing
- **Preprocessing GWAS Data**: Standardizing SNP IDs, chromosome positions, and allele representations.
- **Merging Significant SNPs**: Identifying significant SNPs in one trait and checking their presence in another trait.
- **Filtering by Distance**: Ensuring selected SNPs are at least 200kb apart to minimize LD bias.
- **Significance Testing**: Evaluating SNP significance based on p-values.

### 2. Main Scripts
- **`processing_data.R`**: Automates SNP merging and filtering, producing processed GWAS datasets.
- **`visualization.R`**: Generates plots and summary statistics for GWAS comparisons.
- **`validation.R`**: Constructs contingency tables for SNP validation.

### 3. Results and Outputs
- **Merged SNP Lists**: Filtered SNPs for each trait pair.
- **Statistical Reports**: Summary tables detailing significant associations.
- **Visual Representations**: Manhattan plots, bar charts, and networks illustrating SNP associations.

```

## Workflow
1. Data Acquisition:
Download the necessary GWAS summary statistics files from the provided Google Drive links and place them in the appropriate directories.

2. Preprocessing:
Run the `preprocessing_data.R` script to clean and standardize the GWAS data.
The only_visualizing.R script generates visual outputs (e.g., Manhattan and QQ plots) to help interpret the results, but those plots can also be generated as part of the `preprocessing_data.R` script.

3. Processing:
Execute the `processing_data.R` script to merge significant SNPs and apply distance filtering.

4. Validation:
Use the `validating_data.R` script to construct contingency tables and perform statistical tests, ensuring the observed associations are not due to random chance.

## Directory structure and data localization

In order for the scripts to work, the following directories are needed:

| **Directory**          | **Intended content of the directory** | **Comments** |
|------------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Raw_Data/**          | GWAS summary statistics files for each of the investigated traits. | The full dataset is too large for GitHub. Thus, it contains a placeholder for GWAS summary statistics files. **[Download Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K9kSSyzRsOEMwewDZqyXIZHwqqEOPC9P?usp=drive_link)**. |
| **preprocessed_data/** | Contains four files per trait generated by the `preprocessing_data.R` script: <br> - `trait_effect_snp_clean.tsv` <br> - `trait_effect_snp_significant.tsv` <br> - `trait_snp_clean.tsv` <br> - `trait_snp_significant.tsv` <br><br> **Effect SNP files** (`*_effect_snp_*`): Include columns `rs_id`, `chr`, `pos`, `SE`, `beta`, and `p_value`. <br> **SNP files** (`*_snp_*`): Include columns `rs_id`, `chr`, `pos`, `effect_allele`, and `alt_allele`. | Placeholder for preprocessed trait files.  **[Download Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/118cy-vei9lbwYPbTSJ0FD5uAj3ukUy68?usp=drive_link)**. |
| **processed_data/**   | Contains variants that overlap AD-trait, that are merged and filtered, one file per trait, generated by the `processing_data` script.  | Placeholder for processed trait data. **[Download Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17qK7DhVPpLyZ83b2vtuxb-o5ip26JMMA?usp=drive_link)**.|
| **Images/**           | Contains visualization plots of variant distributions for each trait. | Includes one **Manhattan plot** and one **QQ plot** per trait. |

## Prerequisites

- **R:** The main analysis scripts is written in R.
- **Dependencies:** Install required of the following R packages, in order to run the scripts:
  ```r
  #preprocessing_data.R
  install.packages("dplyr")
  install.packages("R.utils")
  install.packages("data.table")
  install.packages("qqman")
  install.packages("ggplot2")

  #only_visualizing.R
  install.packages("data.table")

## Run Locally

1. Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MLM19/AD_risk_factors.git
```

2. Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd AD_risk_factors
```

3. Download the Data

Download the GWAS summary statistics on the traits that are going to be rearched. Place those files into the Raw_Data/ directory. 
The data used in this reasearch can be found in the placeholder as a google drive link. 

4. Install dependencies
(See the prerequisites section) For R scripts, install necessary packages.

5. Run the scripts
From the main directory of the project run the scripts.
The script are prepared to work with the given directories however they can be adjusted by changing the paths of the data in the scripts.

## Notes
- GWAS data uses **GRCh38** as the reference genome.
- Any compatible GWAS summary statistics can be used with this project, provided the format matches the configurations or is added manually into the configuration section of the `preprocessing_data.R`.

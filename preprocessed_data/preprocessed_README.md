# Preprocessed Data

Here are the preprocessed files generated using the script `preprocessing_data.R`, since the threshold is modifiable in the script. 
Some of the results have been obtained from using `filter_and_plot_significant_snps.R` with the clean data generated from the previous script and changing the threshold. 
They are ordered by threshold, each folder contains one relevant threshold.
